To Run Server:
  C:\path\to\mongod.exe --dbpath C:\path\to\term-project\mongo
  node app.js
  
To Test on Mobile Device:
  Change address to your ip in following locations so device can connect - 
	game.js: 5
	game.html: 6

Starting Up a Game:
> To start a game, click the Find Match button
> Currently the server is only set up to handle a single game per instance,
therefor in order to load a new game the server must be reset
> The game is currently hardcoded to start when 2 players have joined, the number
of players can be changed in app.js: 106
> (OPTIONAL) You can also test the game with background and platform image graphics (this did not
run as well on my android). Uncomment the drawImage line for the background at game.js:153.
Directly after that line is code for drawing the platform, you can comment out the "draw land as grid"
and uncomment the "draw land as img".

How To Play:
> Move around with WASD on a computer or by tilting on mobile device
> Drop bombs using spacebar (or clicking) or by touching the screen to blow up rocks and enemies
> Pick up powerups that drop from rocks (currently have gun powerup)
> Once a player dies they respawn at their starting location
> There is currently no end to the game
