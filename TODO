***CLEANUP THE GIT REPO - DELETE EXTRA FILES AND TRY TO NOT RECOMMIT THEM**********
ADAM
- Implementing lobby features such as the side panel of buttons and private games
- Menu look better

JON
- Powerups
- Splice bullets after leaving map
- Graphics
- Speed up bullets

WILL
- Program game interface such as menu and game commands?
- Portrait/landscape
- Non-destructible rocks
- Show range of bomb explosions

Up for grabs:
- Endgame
- Smoother gameplay
- User studies over carnival - observation of 4-5 people using app for half hour or so, proof of before & after
- Add player-player collisions (maybe also player-bomb collisions)
- Instructions screen
- Closer to bomb = more damage (knockback also?)
- Possible powerup - bomb that explodes on impact
- Bombs explode one another
- Handle players joining and leaving

From user testing:
- Visual cues for what's going on in the game (powerups)
- Controls are unclear
- Chat - all the tabs get squished
- Powerdowns that affect other players
- Undefined player in chat
- Doesn't pick up powerups if moving along wall
- Options for duration/bombs/
- Game creation screen for inviting & stuff
- Get rid of top and bottom thing with a viewport tag
- More powerups
- Matching art styles
